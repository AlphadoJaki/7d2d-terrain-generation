# Introduction

**Terrain generator** is one of the core parts of **Random World Generator** \(RWG\).  
Any terrain features, such as a _plain_, _mountain_ and _ocean_, are formed by this terrain generator.  
So, you can modify this for more various world, for themed specific world such as _Asia_-like or _Europe_-like, and even for unnatural world such as _super-flat_.

In this book, we show summary of terrain generation at first, and then describe some tips to start modding.  
In Chapter 1, we describe how terrain generation is processed with several parts.  
In Chapter 2, we suggest some nice editors and good setup for faster terrain generation.  
After that, we finally describe guides.
