# FastTurbulence
Distort "sourceModule" using FastNoise. Larger power, more wavy/warping output. Larger frequency, more noisy output.

Ensure to use unique seed_additive, unless you expect completely same noise with others.

## Parameters
### sourceModule
Choose which module to distort.

### frequency
Frequency of FastNoise used to distort.

### power
Amplitude of FastNoise used to distort.

### roughness
Octove count of FastNoise used to distort.
