# ExponentialOutput
Maps the "sourceModule" onto an exponential curve. This module expect "sourceModule" to take -1 to 1 value. Output value is scaled back to -1 to 1 value.

## Parameters
### sourceModule
Choose which module to curve.

### exponent
Choose exponential curve. 1 is no change. Larger than 1 is sharpen. Smaller than 1 is rocky.
